	<p>I am a UX designer currently working at <a href="www.practicefusion.com">Practice Fusion</a> in San Francisco. I have been designing for healthcare for the past 4 years and love translating difficult paper-based workflows into seamless software experiences. I currently work closely with product managemenet, engineering, and other designers to design product features from ideation to implementation.</p>


	<p>Evenings, weekends, and vacation you'll find me perusing record bins, tinkering with synthesizers, or on hiking trails with the family. I enjoy making people laugh and a pint of guinness every now and then.</p>
